# FANCY_NUMBERS_COMBO
---
I did this piece of code for getting all the number combinations for the vehicle number plates, yeah the code is very simple and easy to be understood.

# TO-RUN
---
``` python3 fancy_combo.py pass_fav_no_here```
  Ex: ```python3 fancy_combo.py 9```

# OUTPUT
---
This outputs all the 4-digit possible number combinations of the fancy number required.
